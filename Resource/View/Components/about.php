                    I define myself as a passionate developer of web and 
                    desktop applications, specialized in technologies such 
                    as Laravel, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, React, Tailwind, 
                    Python, and PHP, with extensive experience in Eloquent 
                    ORM. My approach goes beyond mere aesthetics; I am 
                    committed to creating distinctive digital experiences by 
                    combining creativity with responsibility. My goal is to 
                    find the perfect balance between functionality and 
                    innovation in every project.
                    <br>
                    I am currently seeking new opportunities to contribute to 
                    exciting projects and expand my horizons as a developer. 
                    I am passionate about languages: I am a native Spanish speaker, 
                    have an intermediate (B1) level of Italian, and I am currently 
                    improving my English, with a particular focus on technical 
                    English for programming and professional communication. I am 
                    also interested in learning other languages in the future, 
                    as I believe effective communication is key in a globalized 
                    environment.
